##  README.md

### Purpose of this repository

We want to provide you with some very simple examples of how to use ReSim. This repository is provided as a simple, stripped down example so you can walk through getting ReSim up and running before integrating ReSim with your own system. This resources are to be used with the [ReSim Getting Started Guide](https://docs.resim.ai/setup/).

### Areas to be highlighted

This Getting Started guide will highlight the following areas:

1. Providing an experience build that allows you to create a simple scene
  - `Note:` The experience folders in this repository are for local testing purposes only. Your experience build will pull the experiences from S3 and you will reference them using the `--location` flag when creating experiences as outlined in the [ReSim Experience Documentation](https://docs.resim.ai/setup/adding-experiences/).
2. Creating a metrics build that takes the outputs of the experience build and creates some simple metrics
3. Demonstrates sample metrics graph to see how the metrics are displayed

### Contributions

We want to keep this example as simple as possible, while also highlighting the value of ReSim. Feel free to submit a Pull Request if you have any suggestions on how to improve it.
