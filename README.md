##  README.md

### Purpose of this repository

We want to provide you some very simple examples of how to use ReSim. This repository is provided as a simple, stripped down example so you can walk through how to get ReSim up and running before specifically getting your code ready for ReSim. 

### Areas to be highlighted

This Getting Started guide will highlight the following areas:

1. Providing an experience build that allows you to create a simple scene
2. Creating a metrics build that takes the outputs of the experience build and creates a simple metric
3. An example for you to look through to see how things are formatted in order for them to be used in ReSim

### Contributions

We want to keep this example as simple as possible, while also highlighting the value of ReSim. Feel free to submit a Pull Request if you have any suggestions on how to improve this example.
